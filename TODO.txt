TODO
- fix espressif targets support through esptool transport https://github.com/espressif/esptool
- port to micropython ?
- consider using bunch ( https://pypi.org/project/bunch/ ) instead of namedtuple as parser output
    - maybe useful to enable autocompletion
        class MyBunch(Bunch):
            def __dir__(self):
                # s = set(super.__dir__(self))
                s = set(super().__dir__())
                for key in self:
                    s.add(key)
                return s

deprecated by SPIRIT and IP-XACT support through dedicated parser:
    - create IP-XACT to SVD conversion, based on kactus2 converter XSLT rules https://github.com/kactus2/k2xml_converter
