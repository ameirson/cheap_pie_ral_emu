TODO
- upgrade to pynrfjprog https://pypi.org/project/pynrfjprog/
    https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pynrfjprog/blob/master/pynrfjprog/examples/memory_read_write.py
- upgrade to python3
    - Jlink still based on python2.7
- consider using bunch ( https://pypi.org/project/bunch/ ) instead of namedtuple as parser output
    - maybe useful to enable autocompletion
        class MyBunch(Bunch):
            def __dir__(self):
